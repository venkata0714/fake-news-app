## ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Web App

This is a lightweight, production-ready web application built with **Streamlit** for classifying news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using a traditional machine learning model trained on TF-IDF features.

---

### ðŸš€ Features

* ðŸ§  **Pretrained ML model** using `scikit-learn` and `TfidfVectorizer`
* ðŸ§¹ **NLTK-based preprocessing** with stemming and stopword removal
* ðŸ§ª Interactive **web interface** with example inputs
* âœ… Supports long-form article inputs (up to 3000 characters)
* âš¡ Fast predictions without needing transformers or GPU

### ðŸ§° Technologies Used

* Python 3.8+
* Streamlit
* scikit-learn
* NLTK
* Joblib
